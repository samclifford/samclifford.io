## Bio

I'm a Data Scientist at a tech company in the Netherlands where I support company-wide experimentation as part of the Research and Consultancy team. My work has involved working within the experimentation track and with other teams within the company on experiment quality and experiment impact. This also includes internal training on our culture of experimentation, the science behind it, and our use of sequential testing. 

Prior to joining industry I was an Assistant Professor at the [London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](https://lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/clifford.sam) on pneumococcal disease and vaccination and dengue fever under Dr Stefan Flasche and on SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 as part of the [CMMID COVID-19 Working Group](https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/). My teaching included module coordination and lecturer of 2491 - Data Challenge and lecturer in 2490 - Machine Learning.

Prior to that, I worked as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow and Research Associate at <a href="http://www.qut.edu.au">Queensland University of Technology</a> on a range of environmental and environmental health problems such as jaguar conservation, reef conservation, air pollution and its health impacts, and the prevention of the spread of Dengue fever.

In addition, I taught teach mathematics and statistics to first year science students in the unit [SEB113 - Quantitative Methods in Science](https://www.qut.edu.au/study/unit?unitCode=SEB113). 
In 2015, the SEB113 teaching team was the recipient of the Vice Chancellor's Performance Award for innovation in redesiging the unit for student success through encouraging engagement with multiple technologies.

## Education

My undergrad was in applied and computational mathematics, focussing on fluid dynamics in my honours year under the supervision of Dr Glenn Fulford and Dr Tim Moroney.

Between 2009 and 2013 I was a **PhD student** at the **[International Laboratory for Air Quality and Health](https://www.qut.edu.au/research/our-research/institutes-centres-and-research-groups/international-laboratory-for-air-quality-and-health)**  under the supervision of Professors [Lidia Morawska](http://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/morawska/) and [Kerrie Mengersen](http://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/mengerse/) and Dr [Sama Low Choy](http://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/lowchoy/), where I completed a thesis on spatio-temporal modelling of air pollution.

Research from my PhD and postdoctoral time with ILAQH has resulted in a number of papers looking at spatio-temporal modelling of urban air pollution with a view to estimating human exposure and modelling its health impact.


## Software

Occasionally I publish useful code, including a package for tidying MCMC output from coda or rjags entitled [mmcc](http://mmcc.njtierney.com/), and a package to bring some of the common linear model diagnostics like variance inflation factors and tables of confidence intervals to GAMs from mgcv in [mgcv.helper](https://github.com/samclifford/mgcv.helper).

I have also developed a handful of Shiny apps for investigating the dynamics of COVID transmission and quarantine.

## Teaching

At LSHTM I have been involved in running practicals for Stats in Epidemiology and Population Health, guest lectured in Introduction to Statistical Computing, and run short course modules on Introduction to Spatial Analysis in R and Modern Techniques in Modelling Infectious Disease Dynamics.

From 2013 to mid 2018 I was been involved in the development and delivery of *SEB113 - Quantitative Methods for Science* as part of the ST01 Bachelor of Science course at Queensland University of Technology. The course covers a variety of mathematical and statistical topics taught through scientific case studies and makes use of the R language for all computation.
